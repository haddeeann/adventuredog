Modern technology is great. I heard about genetic testing for people a few years ago. So when I heard about genetic testing for dogs I was curious. My genetic testing was useful because I was unsure of my heritage and I wanted to know about my family. So what would be the point of genetic testing for dogs?

First, genetic testing is useful to inform you of the health risks associated with your dog’s breed. When you get the genetic test back it will tell you what kind of mix your dog is and a good test will list the possible health risks for that breed. Dog owner's worst fears about their pet is the animal develops serious medical problems. Genetic testing for dogs is still in its infancy, and so experts want to be aware of its limits in accuracy. 

Secondly, genetic testing can tell you about the disposition of a dog. For example, when I looked up what to expect from my corgi’s personality it lists: happy, smart, fun-loving, loyal, stubborn, and playful. And it’s true. I literally had to stop while I was writing this and play some fetch. He gets bored easily. He is exceptionally loyal and he is always up for an adventure. He is also very stubborn. And getting him to do things that he doesn’t want to is downright impossible.

If you have a good test it will come back listing the possible health risks. But those results are more accurate for some brands of tests than others. Also be aware that the research into dog genetics and the associated health risks are still in their infancy. So, just take it with a grain of salt that correlation doesn’t mean causation. So just because a gene is associated with a disease does not mean it causes the disease.

Each of the brands of tests also does the genetic testing a little bit differently and interprets the results a little bit differently. The results of the genetic testing can be complex and the consumer/pet owner might need help understanding the results. For example, with some conditions they are associated across a pattern of genes and the genetic testing company might only test for some conditions. The two most common dog genetic tests are Wisdom Panel Health DNA test (on Amazon) and Embark Dog DNA (on Amazon).
 
## Which One Is Better?
Embark is the most comprehensive and expensive. It’s often rated as being more thorough on Amazon because it gets back more nuances of breed in mixed breed animals. Wisdom Panel Health DNA test coming in a close second place for accuracy. With Wisdom Panel there are more reviews on Amazon of dog owners getting inaccurate results and vague results. So although Wisdom is less expensive, and technical tests for more kinds of breeds, if you have a more of a mixed breed type of dog, it’s better to go with the more expensive Embark test. If you don’t expect many surprises and nuance you might be ok just getting the less expensive Wisdom Panel Health DNA test.
If you are going to choose Wisdom, which is still highly regarded, it’s good to know there are two types of Wisdom test as follows:
Wisdom Panel Essential– $99.99 Tests for 350+ breeds, types, and varieties, 25+ genetic conditions, 35+ traits, and more.
Wisdom Panel Premium– $159.99 The most comprehensive dog DNA test available. Screens for 200+ genetic conditions, 350+ breeds, types, and varieties, 35+ traits, and more.

Embarks breed database covers most of the dog breeds that are recognized by the American Kennel Club. The company analyzes 110 times more genetic markers than its competition so it’s more granular. And Embark claims a 95% to 99% accuracy for the results.
