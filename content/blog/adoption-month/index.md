October is a dog month! What a great time to celebrate a new furry best friend. If it’s time to take the plunge and get a new dog there are going to be some things you want to think about. First might be things like where to go for a dog? What kinds of breeds are best? How to train them. 

A great place to start looking is your local animal shelter. You can get a feel for what kinds of dog you are looking for. Do you want a constant companion or more of a guard dog? Something the size that dwarfs a small child and cast shadows you can stand in? Or something you can fit in a purse to take to the movies?

## Find a dog to adopt

Petfinder is a great place to find a shelter near you. You’ll want to think about temperament and what kind of dog is going to fit into your house. If you have kids or other animals you also want to be aware that there is special consideration there. Some dogs are better with kids than others. Some dogs get along with cats and others are more aggressive.

## Basic supplies

You also want to consider a basic inventory of things you will need after you get your new furry family member. Buy a collar that is for his or her size, but if it’s a puppy consider something adjustable. With a puppy, it will be more time to train and there could be a chewing phase. Puppies require more play as well. Be sure to make the time to care for, train, walk the dog and play every day.

## Dog training

Dog training is an important skill as well. There are books and blog posts about how to do it. So it’s really a preference in how you would like to get your information. There are also apps and social media facebook groups, if you’d like to be interactive or social about your learning.

## Be cautious

Be aware that if you adopt a dog from a kennel they could have kennel cough. Dogs get sick easier from being close to each other in kennel conditions. The dog will be bright and alert but can have deep coughing or gagging. Most dogs with kennel cough do not have a fever. Take the dog to the vet when you first get him or her. But also, of course, if any symptoms of illness come up. Your dog’s veterinarian will be able to prescribe an antibiotic to prevent any secondary infections.

## Conclusion

Any month is a great month to adopt a new furry friend! Be sure to be prepared for all the love, attention, and training that a new friend will require. Additionally there is costs like vet visits to be aware of. When adopting consider your own schedule and the amount of time you have to dedicate to a new animal. Also think about who you will get along with as your new best friend.

And if you are adopting your new furry friend into a large family of other animals and kids be sure to think about how your new furry family member will fit in!
