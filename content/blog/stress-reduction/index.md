Stress and anxiety can be as big an issue for pets as it is for people. Dogs can suffer from depression and separation anxiety. And depending on the breed and dog, it might need more attention and exercise to deal with the problem. How can you tell if your dog seems to be suffering from these kinds of problems?

## Some of the signs of stress and anxiety in dogs
One of the bigger signs of stress and anxiety can be a dog chewing on things when you are away.  This can be a sign that your dog misses you and is trying to take comfort in the things it knows.

Another big sign of stress might be when dogs are not eating their food or acting like they usually do. If there is something wrong with the food, this would make sense but if everything seems fine then maybe your pet needs more attention from you. It could be a sign that your dog isn't getting enough exercise, play, or attention.

In addition to regular food and water, your dog needs daily activities to engage its attention as well. Taking your dog on walks and playing with him or her is a great way to help with your dog's anxiety. You can also try giving them a toy or two that they enjoy playing with when you leave the house so it has something familiar and comforting while you are away.

Other signs of stress could be shaking or hiding during storms.  A storm can be scary for dogs because of the loud noises and changes in air pressure. Dog anxiety training is a great way to work on these problems with your pet.

## Supplements might help
You might also want to consider dog supplements that help reduce stress, like Dog Appeasing Pheromone (DAP). DAP is an alternative supplement you put into their food that can help make your dog feel more comfortable and safe. Dog anxiety training is a great option as well, but DAP might also be able to help with any issues they have when you are not home or during storms.

Another supplement that many people find helpful is products with CBD.   CBD is a chemical compound found in hemp and cannabis plants. While CBD does not cause the same psychoactive effects as THC, it still provides numerous benefits for your dog's health such as helping with anxiety or reducing inflammation. There are many different options when choosing products that contain CBD so you may need to do some research beforehand if you want to find the right one.

Some other common ingredients in dog calming treats include chamomile, passionflower, melatonin, L-theanine and L-tryptophan, and valerian root.  These common ingredients are generally considered safe for human and dog supplements. Many of these same ingredients are things that people use to treat insomnia. 

## Choosing a calming vest
If your dog suffers from temporary anxiety due to thunderstorms a great solution is to try a thunder shirt. These are vests that wrap around your dog in a snug fashion and give the dog the comfort of being held. These are great during storms because, in addition to the noise-causing your dog alarm, the pressure of the storm often causes distress. 

The wrapping of the thunder shirt around your dog helps relieve the air pressure difference that happens in a storm. In addition, many dogs enjoy the comfort of small spaces and being confined. This varies from dog to dog though. And some dogs find wearing outfits to be more distressing than comforting.

Since this varies so widely, it's best to just try it out if you find your dog is hiding during storms. The thunder shirts should only be used for situations where your dog is experiencing short-term anxiety due to a particular situation. Like a storm. For long-term anxiety, like you being away at work, its effectiveness is reduced.

The dog would get used to wearing the vest and not get the same comfort after a while.

Be sure to get a properly fitting thunder shirt. It should be snug, but able to wrap around your dog's body and down most of its length. As your dog grows it's important to be sure to update the size if it grows out of its old one. Most of the thunder shirts I've seen have a size guide that goes by weight. 

## Adequate exercise and attention
In addition to the above suggestions, be sure to give your dog enough play, exercise, and attention. During stressful situations like storms, it's great to be sure that he or she has a good safe, and comfortable hiding spot and attention if he or she needs it.

And if you are away for long periods it's important to be sure to play with your dog more when you are home. Exercise and play are exceptionally important to your dog's mental health. Taking time out of your day to play with your dog can give him or her the exercise that they need to curb bad behaviors that arise out of boredom. 

Some ideas for play that you can do with your dog include playing fetch, running around in the yard, or parking with them. Most dogs love chasing a ball and it's great for both their physical health as well as mental health.

It is also important to make sure you are giving your dog enough attention when they need it though. Playing isn't always what makes them feel better, especially if there is a storm. Sometimes it's good just to calmly stroke their fur and speak to them in a soothing tone.

## Conclusion
These are some ideas to get you started in understanding your dog a little bit better. Sometimes what is seen as bad behavior such as chewing means that your dog needs more exercise and attention. So instead of just punishing the bad behavior, it's important to be sure to increase the exercise that they get.

And when your dog has anxiety because of storms or separation there are things that you can do to help! It's also good for us as well. Play, walking, and affection are extremely healthy activities for us as humans. So when we give our pets more of these things we also win.
