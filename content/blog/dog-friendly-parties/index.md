Everyone loves a party. And dog parties are no exception. To throw a dog party you want to think about all the things that you’d think about for a party for people, but for dogs. You want to invite your dog owning friends and their dogs. And just like a real party, you want to be aware of social dynamics and how well dogs get along with others.
Some dogs love each other and play well. Their styles mesh well together. Aggressive playing dogs play well with others with the same style. And older dogs tend to want to just be left alone.
Venue. Your own backyard is the best choice if there is a lot of room. Otherwise a local dog park makes a good option. Just be sure that there is a dog fence and it’s in good repair. Check the weather as well. You wouldn’t want the dogs to overheat or freeze. Or just stand around in an outdoor party in the rain.
Sending the invites. This could be done through all the dogs owners facebooks or their pets facebook if they have one. Fun! Or you could hand make some puppy theorem invitations to make it special.
Decor. This part is for you to make it feel like a celebration. Make it festive and do more work if you want. Balloons are a great idea. But be sure that the dogs won’t pop them and scare the more timid dogs. Also be sure none of the decorations would be small items that dogs would be tempted to chew on and eat and there for choke.
For fun you could think of a theme like a Halloween theme with costumes. Birthdays are fun to celebrate or just Valentine's day celebrations with a love theme and dogs.
Dog friendly snacks and food. Dog pupcakes are a nice treat. And party favors are a great idea. 

Some great snack ideas include fresh vegetables and fruits (carrots, apples (no seeds), pumpkin, sweet potatoes, broccoli, snow or snap peas, red & yellow peppers)
Healthy dog treats: there is plenty to choose from out there. Just be sure that you are aware some dogs have allergies and are sensitive to certain proteins.

## Fresh water

Be sure to have lots of bowls of fresh water available. Be sure to put ice in the water bowls if it’s hot. And be sure to not put the bowls in a way that the dogs would need to compete for water. Don’t put it in a path where people walk and be sure all the dogs have enough bowls if they get thirsty they can have their own.
Don’t forget the people's food and snacks and their entertainment.  Be sure to feed the people food that is safe for the dogs to eat, in case some gets dropped. Many people don’t think twice about feeding dogs people food and aren’t aware of what foods dogs are allergic to.
It’s best that most of the dogs have met each other before the party. Dog socializing can have group dynamics and each person is going to have different rules for their dogs. You want to discuss what each person’s rules are for their dogs before just hanging out with 15 large breed dogs who don’t know each other and owners who think wandering off is a good idea and one bone to fight over.

## Plan party games 

ou can also set up obstacle courses and games. Set up a time for all the games to start and obstacle courses keeping in mind how many dogs that you’ve invited. Be sure to think of how big your space is and how many dogs can realistically run around and play. 
Dogs are pretty easy to please, but make sure they have some fun activities planned to keep them occupied and out of trouble. Plan games that are fun and can include all the guests.
Consider a ball pit with tennis balls. Dogs love playing with balls, so imagine all your dogs at the party surrounded by them. It can also turn into a big game of fetch with human guests playing along. The key here is to have so many balls there is never a fight for resources.
Build an obstacle or agility course with jumps, tunnels, and hoops. They can be made out of PVC pipe, or you can purchase one online. The key here is to motivate the dogs with good rewards or treats. And be sure to have different agility levels for beginners. 
If it’s warm outside, include some water games. You can use a sprinkler that dogs can use to cool down if it gets too hot. Water games can be as easy as a dog pool and a sprinkler.
Get a long and sturdy rope and have dogs take turns playing tug-of-war. Again the key is to be sure that you never make the dogs compete for resources. Have plenty of ropes and be sure to show the dogs that there is always going to be more ropes around if they lose one. 
It’s a good idea to set up an area for time out if dogs get over excited or need some space. Decide how to decide slight arguments over toys and post the rules for settling dog disputes and the rules of the games. Just like humans, dogs can be allergic to things so it’s a good idea to give everyone a list of food, games and other guests that will be arriving at the party. That gives each guest the option of what they will do about dog social structures and allergies.
Make party favors for the guests. A fun way to end your party and say farewell to your furry guests is by handing out “doggy favors.” Some ideas for favors include homemade dog biscuits, store-bought treats, dog shampoo, a voucher for a local pet store, a bone, and a thank-you card. It can be homemade or store bought.
