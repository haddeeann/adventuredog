Are you looking for a great pet sitter and don't know where to start? There are many things to consider when hiring someone to care for your furry friend while you're away. For example, do they have experience with dogs? What about cats? Will the person come into my home or will I need to meet them somewhere else? How much does it cost and what services can be provided? Who should I trust more: A professional Pet Sitter or Dog Walker that has been doing this job for years, or a college student that needs some extra cash in their pocket?

Also, make sure to ask them how they feel about pet sitting at different hours of the day. Some people might be comfortable with taking care of your pup in the morning, while others would prefer not having to get up early for work. With that being said, if you have a dog that is used to getting out and exploring during certain times, it's best to stick to that schedule.

When looking for services there are a lot of great online communities to start looking for a pet care provider. The following is a list of places to look for someone and details about what the online community requires from their pet sitters to qualify.

## Rover

## Trusted House Sitters
Trusted House Sitters is a great site for finding a house sitter and pet sitter at the same time for when you want to go on vacation. So how does finding a dog sitter work?
