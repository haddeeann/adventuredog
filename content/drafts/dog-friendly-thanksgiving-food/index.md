With Thanksgiving around the corner many dog owners are wondering what they can feed their smallest furry family member. We’ve put together a list of food do’s and don'ts for your dog. Since dogs don’t have the same allergies as humans, it’s important to do some research before just sneaking your dog some table food. 

## Thanksgiving food you can feed your dogs
Here are some traditional types of Thanksgiving foods you would serve to your human guests that are ok to feed your dog. Keep in mind seasoning for all of these and you want to be sure to keep the fat content low. A suddenly high fat content meal can cause an upset tummy for a dog.
Turkey (unseasoned/cooked)
Sweet potatoes
Green beans (raw)
Carrots (unseasoned, no garlic or onion)
Pumpkin, cooked or canned
Apples (but not the seeds in large quantities)
Corn (but not on the cob, the cob is a choking hazard)


## Recipe ideas based on Thanksgiving Day foods
If you’d like to make special treats for your dog on Thanksgiving there are also a number of options for recipes. The following are recipes that are dog friendly and easy. Most of them only have a few ingredients and are pretty foolproof to make.

Peanut butter and pumpkin balls
BBQ Liver Treats
Frozen Turkey Dinner
Sweet Potato Treats
Apple Cranberry Cookies
Cranberry Pumpkin Treats
Doggy Meatballs
Turkey Pumpkin Dog Treats
Turkey and Vegetable Dog Meal
Apple Crunk Pupcake
Mini Pumpkin Pies for Dogs

## Poisonous to dogs
Now that we’ve listed the ‘yes’ foods, let’s talk a bit about the ‘no’ foods. This is a short list of the most common things that can cause upset for your dog's tummy. This is to be avoided all year around, but during Turkey day there is more possibility for going to give your dog a treat and not realizing a secondary ingredient is on the ‘no’ list.

Dairy
Onions
Garlic
Tomatoes
Chocolate
Grapes and raisins

## Not good for dogs
This isn’t a poisonous list, but it’s good to watch out for these items and considerations. 
Brussel sprouts
The turkey bones, bones can be bad for dogs. They can get stuck in the intestines and cause an emergency trip to the vet for surgery.
If you give your dog turkey watch out for the turkey twine, it could cause choking. 
Also be aware that high fatty foods, like butter, gravy, and turkey drippings can cause gastrointestinal distress in your dog.  And while those things aren’t poisonous, it still doesn’t make for a pleasant Thanksgiving for your dog to get sick.
