When you are new to training your dog it might be hard to know where to start.  The process of finding a good dog trainer can be mysterious if you are new to it. You'll want to find a dog training professional that you can trust that you're confident is qualified. If you are looking to hire a dog trainer then read this article for advice on how to choose the right dog trainer.

## Specific goals or general obedience?
What are you looking to train your dog to do? Specific tricks and agility or general obedience?  Some dog trainers do obedience work and some do rehabilitation and some do both.  You'll want to find a dog trainer that specializes in what you're looking to train your dog for.

## Training philosophy
Ask the dog trainer about her methods of training and philosophy of training. For example, some dog trainers use choke chains or crates.   You'll want to know whether the dog trainer uses these dog training tools and what they believe any dog would benefit from.

You will want to know about how often and for how long your dog will be working with the dog trainer.  If you have a puppy, it's best to find a dog trainer that has specific training for puppies.

Positive reinforcement training is replacing negative behaviors with positive ones.  If your dog is jumping on the couch, you may want to train them not to jump. You can do this by rewarding your dog with a treat whenever they behave and following directions.

Ask the trainer if they use positive reinforcement training.  All dog trainers should use positive reinforcement dog training methods.

## Qualifications and certifications
You will want to know the dog trainer's credentials and certifications. For example, you can find dog trainers that are certified by the APDT (Association of Pet Dog Trainers), IACP (International Association of Canine Professionals) or CPDT-KA (Certified Professional Dog Trainers - Knowledge Assessed).  You can also find dog trainers with a dog training degree or years of experience.

## What kind of clients does the dog trainer work with?
You'll want to know what the dog trainer's dog behavior services are like for different kinds of owners and their dogs. For example, you can find dog trainers that work with dog owners who have a dog with aggression issues, dog behavior problems, and dog obedience.

Ask about the dog training services and whether they can help you train your dog to do what you want them to do.  Dog training might be for general obedience or agility, so find out if your dog trainer is qualified in these areas. 

Some dog trainers offer a dog training guarantee or dog behavior guarantee. Ask the dog trainer about case specifics. If that dog trainer doesn't allow these cases, make sure to ask what they do offer and how successful their policies are with this kind of case.

Make sure your trainer includes teaching you as part of the process. Training the dog owner on how to train the dog is as important as training the dog. An important part of your dog learning new behavior is going to be learning how to train your dog. For example, if your dog is a jumper and jumps on people to greet you, then you'll want to learn how to use positive reinforcement to curb that behavior.

And finally, ask friends who they have used and like. You want to be sure that you are asking people who think like you do and have dogs that are trained the way that you’d like.  For example, if you'd like to get your dog into agility training and you know someone who does that, then a great place to start is to ask who they use.

Recommendations and word of mouth is a great place to start looking for someone that can help you and your dog become better trained together!

## Conclusion
If you're curious about getting your dog better trained a great place to start is by asking questions. Finding the right fit is an important part of the process. You'll want someone that has the same goals for your pet as you and that can fit into your schedule. And don't forget to ask about pricing! Affordability is an important as everything else.
