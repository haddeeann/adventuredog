Dogs get bored just like people do! 

Some signs of dog boredom include: barking at small noises, mischief when you are away, destructive chewing, staring at you, hyper greetings. What can you do about your dog being bored? Fortunately this is an easy solution. Below I list some ideas for play and other activities. The extra bonus is that these activities get you off the couch and engaged as well!

## Play games
Play games with your dogs, dog boredom isn’t just when you are gone. Try a basic game of fetch and tug of war. After that, if your dog is still bored there are plenty of agility games and puzzle games that you can try.


## Take your dog for a walk
This is great exercise for both you and your dog. Walking is good for weight control and mental health for both you and your dog. Plus it’s just nice. Walking increases serotonin and it’s good to move around and see your surroundings. Some ideas could be your local neighborhood, local park and state park.


## Sit outside
Dogs love a change of scenery just as much as people do. Your dog will get bored less if overall he or she gets to switch up where they hang out and move around.


## Go for a car ride
I usually don’t just drive for the sake of driving. But sometimes when my dog is bored I make a special trip to grab a coffee or treat for us. Even a mild drive around the block is a special treat for a dog.


## Take a mini trip
One of the key things for keeping your dog happy during the week is taking advantage of days off to have more fun and exercise than during the week. Be sure to take longer trips or walks on your days off. Being sure to get longer exercise when possible really helps hold off the boredom during the week.


## Switch toys out regularly
Be sure to switch up your toys for your dog. Switching it up can really make a difference for your dog. Switch up chew toys between ropes, stuffed animals and interactive dog puzzles. 


## Make dog dates with other dogs
Schedule a playdate with other dogs. Start forming a dog friendship network if you haven’t already. It can be good socializing for you and your dog.


## Food stuffed toys
Kongs are my personal favorite. Making a recipe that you can find here https://www.kongcompany.com/lets-play/recipes, freeze it. Then give it to the dog for hours of fun.


## Scavenger hunt 
Set it up before you leave the house. Hide food, stuffed treats and toys around the house. When showing your dog the game, help him/her learn the rules of finding toys and that there are toys around the house.


## Music or TV
There’s plenty of dog TV. Play with finding a dog TV showing channel.


## Hiring a sitter 
If your dog is bored, try getting a friend to stop by and let out your dog. Or hire a professional dog sitter to stop by and walk your dog while you are away.
